## Ext Menu Reloaded: A Joomla 4.x/5.x migration (and Joomla 3.x update) for the [Joomla](https://www.joomla.org/) module "ARI Ext Menu"
+ "Ext Menu Reloaded" is a fork of the "ARI Ext Menu" module [(version 2.2.12)](https://www.ari-soft.com/index.php?dl=mod_ariextmenu.zip&f=603102c6915804e7805d227a8c181ff8&t=1701535070&option=com_arismartcontent&task=plugin_handler&handler=a4197fefd329010736ae3073855be045), which was developed by [ARI Soft](https://www.ari-soft.com)
+ The fork intends to make the functionality of the former "ARI Ext Menu" module available for Joomla 4 and 5, because the original module is not provided and supported any more
+ Support for the Joomla update system was added to check and install new releases of the plugin
+ **The code was migrated to the Joomla 4.x and 5.x CMS and module API**
+ The latest 5.0.x release can be used for **Joomla 5.x** and **Joomla 4.x**. Joomla 5 can be used without Compatibility plugin.
+ Earlier patch releases can be used for **Joomla 3.10** and **PHP 8**.

The following aspects of the PHP code were changed or refactured:
+ PHP 8
    + Substitution of curly braces for character access in arrays (i.e. "my_array[0]" instead of "my_array{0}")
    + Declaration of static methods as static (i.e. "static function" instead of "function" only)
+ Joomla 4.x
    + Adaptions to Joomla 4.x CMS and module API
	+ Updated XML file for Joomla 4 installation
	+ Added "defined('_JEXEC') or die()" code to several PHP files
+ Joomla 5.x
    + Major refactoring for Joomla 5 including usage without Backward Compatibility plugin.
